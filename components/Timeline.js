        I went on my first 14er hike named Gray's Peak with my cousin Kris, his
        wife Tiffany, and my cousin Jimmie. It was so difficult adjusting to the
        high altitude, I felt light headed, and I wanted to turn back halfway up
        the mountain. We eventually made it to the top up the and the scenery
        was so beautiful that I didn't have any regrets going on the hike.

      <TimelineStep title="Appendicitis Surgery 💉">
        During this day, I had a very bad stomach ache and thought it may have
        been food poisoning. As the day went by, I was starting to get sharp
        pain in the lower left of my abdomen and it was becoming increasingly
        difficult to walk. I told my mom after researching on the internet that
        I thought I had appendicitis. She didn't believe me. I had a final this
        day so I was worried that I would have to miss it instead I went to
        school and told my professor after the test I am going to the hospital
        to get diagnosed for appendicitis and he thought I was crazy to be
        taking the test. I took the test in 25 minutes, limped out of school,
        and headed to the hospital. I was diagnosed with appendicitis and had my
        appendix removed. I got almost a perfect score on the math final.

        As I was homeschooled and my mom went through a difficult time, I was
        behind in my academics. After taking the accuplacer, I was placed at the
        lowest level for Math, English, and Reading Comprehension. I felt like a
        failure and that I wasn't smart enough to attend college. I spent the
        next 6 months teaching myself those subjects for 7-8 hours per day.
        After failing the test 7 times in a row, I finally placed at college
        level for all 3 subjects.
